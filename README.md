## TODO:
### Interactive World Map: Using amCharts, integrate an interactive world map showing COVID-19 statistics by country. Users can click on a country to see detailed statistics like new cases, total recoveries, and death rates.
### Vaccination Data: Display data on vaccination progress, including the percentage of the population vaccinated, types of vaccines used, and daily vaccination rates.
### News and Updates Section: Integrate a section that pulls in the latest news or updates related to COVID-19 from reputable sources.
### Heat Maps: Use heat maps to show the intensity of the outbreak in different regions. This visual representation can be very effective in conveying the severity of the situation.
### Demographic Breakdown: If data is available, provide insights into how COVID-19 is impacting different demographics (age, gender, etc.). Pie charts or donut charts could be used for this purpose.
### Comparative Analysis: Add functionality to compare COVID-19 data between different countries or regions. This could be in the form of bar charts or line graphs.
